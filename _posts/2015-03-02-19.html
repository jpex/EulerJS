/**
 * Counting Sundays
 * Problem 19
 *
 *  You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do 
 *    some research for yourself.
 *
 *     
 *    * 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
 *    * Thirty days has September,
 *    * April, June and November.
 *    * All the rest have thirty-one,
 *    * Saving February alone,
 *    * Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 *    * And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 *    * A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, 
 *      but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
 *
 *  How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth 
 *  century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
