 *   the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
 *
 *   What is the smallest positive number that is evenly 
 *   divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

/**
 * The idea of this setup is to limit the number of times a loop
 * is applied. The index (i) only goes through the highest number
 * it has to be divisible through, then only goes through the lower
 * numbers if it's also divisible by (n - 1). It then loops from
 * highest to lowest to further reduce number of checks for incorrect
 * numbers.
