/**
 * Even Fibonacci numbers
 * Problem 2
 *
 *   Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by 
 *   adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, 
 *   the first 10 terms will be:
 *
 *   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 *
 *   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose 
 *   values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the 
 *   even-valued terms.
